  <title>The Noble Greyhound</title>

  Whiskey the greyhound lived in a box house at 5001 Fletcher St.  He hadn't always lived there of course, but sometimes it felt like he had, for his happiest memories were formed sunning himself on the bed by the window, waiting for his master to get home.
  
  He kept a careful watch of all the goings-on in the neighborhood from his perch.  Children, cars, bicycles, other dogs - especially other dogs - were surveyed, catalogued, assessed, and eventually, disregarded.  For none could compare to his master: the most interesting, curious, and warmest man he had ever met.  Oh, and the best ear scratcher, too!
  
  One day, while Whiskey the greyhound was set atop his usual perch in the living room waiting for his master, Buzz the bee flew into Whiskey's window, startling poor Whiskey from his concentration.  
  
  "Bzzz, hello Whiskey!" Buzz the bee gleefully buzzed, flying around Whiskey's head in excited circles.
  
  "Go away, Buzz the bee," Whiskey angirly snapped, his eyes never straying from the street below.  "I'm waiting for master, but I can't stand that incessant buzzing!"
  
  "Bzzzz, well, why don't you make me--" Buzz started to reply, when: 
  
  GULP!
  
  Whiskey swallowed him in one swift bite, chewing him three times before swallowing, and never taking his eyes off the street below, in case his master walked up the drive.
